# Digital_Signal_Processing_Project2

The project is related to psychoacoustic signal encoding. Particularly, in the first part, we analyze a windowed music signal andwe apply various functions and processes to it using psycoacoustic model. In the second part we implement a series of bandpass filters, also known as a filterbank (analysis and synthesis filters) and we apply quantization using two different methods.

This project created as part of the course "Digital Signal Processing" at School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, NTUA and the aim of this work is NOT to present it as my personal research but as my approach to the problems given. Please read the project's prompt (provided in Greek) for detailed descriptions of the tasks.
