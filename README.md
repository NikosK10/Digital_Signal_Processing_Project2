# Digital_Signal_Processing_Project2

The project is related with Psychoacoustic Signal encoding. Particularly, in the first part, we "read" a windowed music signal and we apply some functions and process on it using psycoacoustic model. In the second part we implement some series of bandpass filters/Filterbank (analysis and synthesis filters) and we apply the process of quantisation wth two methods.

This project created as part of the course "Digital Signal Processing" at School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, NTUA and the aim of this work is NOT to present it as my own research but as my approach to the problems given. Read the project's prompt in the uploaded file for more details about the 3 tasks (It is given in Greek).
